# 🌐 Anomalia – Frontend Dashboard

A real-time cross-domain anomaly detection dashboard built with **React + Vite**, part of the **Anomalia** platform. This UI enables interactive exploration and visualization of global events like earthquakes, weather anomalies, epidemics, and social trends.

## 🧭 Overview

The Anomalia dashboard is a lightweight, fast, and modular SPA frontend that connects with Spring Boot-based backend microservices to render real-time, anomaly-tagged data. It provides route-based navigation, dynamic components, and an extensible structure.

## 📁 Project Structure

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
